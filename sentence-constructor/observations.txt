Tried to keep my prompt short (with fewer subprompts).

However, adding more rules for more specific instructions makes my sections chunky - i.e. conditions section. And both Mistral and Chatgpt auto model ignored the keep arabic in pure form (for verbs, no conjugations or tenses)

Changing the word to be clearer - nonfinite verbs



#Week 2 stuff

1. Treat the AI like a junior dev
2. Go step by step, create a plan and establish rules before any coding
3. Use case example of Cursor AI
4. Using WSL with Linux/Ubuntu env for easier dev
5. The rules come in a file within the repo for the cursor ai to go through as it codes
6. The process is iterative, and in chunks- plan is to develop one feature at a time (agile), then test before implement and then try new feature
